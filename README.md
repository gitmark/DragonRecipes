## Algorithms and Examples for Lexical and Syntactic Analysis

### Version History

11/30/2019 - Initial version. This project is new but will eventually provide example code for processing text using lexical and syntactic analysis. Basically, it will demonstrate front-end compiler techniques. Some explanation of the algorithms will be provided; however, the code is also intended to supplement existing compiler texts.

Currently adding Grammar and Production classes to calculate the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a grammar.
